# Python Numbers
# There are three numeric types in Python: int, float, complex

# x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 1j   # complex

# print(z)
# print(type(z))

# Int
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length

a = 1
b = 35656222554887711
c = -3255522

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))


# Float
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals

d = 1.10
e = 1.0
f = -35.59

print(type(d))
print(type(e))
print(type(f))

# Complex
# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part

g = 3+5j
h = 5j
i = -5j

print(type(g))
print(type(h))
print(type(i))
